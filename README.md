**Usage:**

* See the "SQLRG_TEST" scene.
* Database in the Streaming Assets folder: DBTestMe.sqlite
* Add interface "ISqlRG" to your class.
* Follow the "SqlRG_ExampleData.cs" on how to set up the class.
* Add variables to your class by updating the "DBXref", "DBData" to handle the conversions.

**NOTE:**

* Useful as order of variables doesn't matter.
* If the table does not exist it will be added. 
* However, if adding additional variables to an existing database table, you will need to manually add them to the table using a DB editor.
